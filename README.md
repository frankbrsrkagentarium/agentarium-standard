Agentarium v1 Standard

Modular blueprint for packaging artificial minds.

This repository defines the open-source structure for Agentarium Agent Packages, including:

identity

reasoning

personality

datasets

This standard is designed so AI builders can download, inspect, modify, and integrate modular agents into their pipelines.

More coming soon.
